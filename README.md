# Unix Timestamp Clock

## Intro

I needed to see the current Unix Timestamp all the time,
 just as [injcristianrojas](https://github.com/injcristianrojas/UTCClock) and 
[mibus ](https://github.com/mibus/MultiClock) for UTC.

## Install

### Automatic

Go to https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1375/unix-timestamp-clock/ and turn on the extension.

### Manual

```
cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
git clone https://github.com/se1exin/unix-timestamp-clock.git unix-timestamp-clock@se1exin.github.com
